Each item is hidden at first (because of wow.js) but they fly in from the left as you scroll down the page.\\nI have some category links at the top of the grid that call a working custom jQuery function that displays/hides certain grid items based on the link you click. each link has a category associated with it, and displays all grid items with that category when clicked. It also hides all grid items that do not have that category.\\nMy issue is that the category links don't display all grid items in that category unless you scroll to the bottom of the page and load all grid items. the links will only show the grid items that have been loaded by scrolling down. \\nIf I remove the wow animations, all grid items are visible on page load and the category links work fine, links fully show all grid items in that category.\\nI really want to keep the wow animations, they look cool and give life to the boring webpage.\\nDoes anyone know of a way to somehow load all the elements (grid items) on page load while keeping the hidden wow.js effect? \\nI know this is a confusing question and I probably did not explain it the best.

       " \"From what I understand, the popup exists within it's own visual tree. However, I've noticed a few properties, Clip and ClipToBounds. What I am wanting to do is Visually clip a popup at the right and bottom edges of a window regardless of the fact that the popup is independent of the bounds of the window. I'm not using XAML, but if somebody knows how to do it in XAML, then that's fine. I can get to the main window using System.Windows.Application.Current.MainWindow. Is it possible from this to get a value that I can use to clip the popup? I'm assuming that if there is a value that I can use, then I would be able to bind the clipping of the popup to that value. This is really not necessary since after the popup initially opens, if the window gets moved or resized, the popup closes. So I would really only need to clip the popup when it opens. The reason I would like to do this is because although I am using a popup, I don't want it to appear as a popup that exists outside of the window.

       " 'I\\'m designing a CQRS event-sourced system (not my first) where my read models are denormalized and stored in a read-optimized document database (MongoDb). Nothing special. Now this particular read model, is a document that contains a user id and a potentially large array of groups that the user is a member of:\\n\\nThere could be 10\\'s of thousands of users that are a member of a single group (just as one example: imagine a group that every staff member is a member of).\\nKeeping in mind the reason I\\'m using CQRS in the first place, is that I need to scale my reads (or rather, handle my reads differently given the need to avoid lots of joins), and I\\'m expecting a significant volume of writes. This isn\\'t the only reason I\\'m using CQRS and event-sourcing, but it is one major catalyst.\\nNow the problem I have is when someone updates a group name, (which I\\'m predicting will happen quite frequently) my read model needs updating. This means a single user modification to a single piece of data, is going to cause 10\\'s of thousands of updates in my read store. \\nI am well aware of all the techniques I can apply to handle dispatching the update to avoid temporal coupling, however I am concerned with the number of documents that will be updated per single user modification. \\nI\\'ve read several SO answers that ask this exact type of question, and most answers suggest that either you need to strike a balance, or not worry about the mass updates. But IMO, this is not really an option. There really is no balance to be had in this type of read model (any re-modelling of the document would still necessitate the group name appearing just as many times, no matter how it\\'s re-modelled), and simply accepting the mass quantities of updates is counter-productive to the idea of the super fast read store, as it will now be under severe load due to the constant updates that are almost always going to be queued up. Essentially what will happen, is the denormalizing process is going to bottleneck, and the queue is going to grow over time (until there is some respite from users updating group names), and reading will become slow as a side-effect. \\nBefore anyone jumps on me and asks whether I know that this bottleneck will occur, the answer is \"it should, but obviously I can\\'t be sure\". But, based on knowing how many changes are made in the existing system that I\\'m replacing, and, keeping in mind this is not the only type of model in the document database that will require updating, I have pretty good cause to be concerned. As I said, there are several other read models - that may not have the same number of updates - but will nevertheless add to the write load in the read store. And, the read store can only take so many writes.\\nI can think of two solutions (one dumb, one not so dumb):\\n\\nStore a version in each document, and to not update the read\\nmodel when an event occurs. Then when a read occurs for a particular\\ndocument, I check for staleness, and if the version is stale (due to\\na proceeding command), I apply the last change to that document\\nbefore storing and returning it. However, my instinct tells me that \\neventually every document is going to get updated regardless, and\\nthis is just adding additional overhead to the read. I also have no\\nidea how the versioning would actually work\\nUse a relational read model and have the single join. This seems the\\nmost sensible option, as I would just update the join table, and all\\nis good. But the reads wouldn\\'t be as fast, and it just feels a bit\\nmore inferior to a pure select * from tablename approach.\\n\\nMy question: \\nAre there any standard techniques for combating this type of issue? Is the second option I offered simply the best I can hope for? \\nI would honestly have thought that this type of problem would occur all the time in a CQRS event-sourced systems, where denormalized data needs to be kept in sync, but there seems to be a lack of discussion about it in the community which leads me to believe I\\'m missing an obvious solution, or my read model needs improvement.\\n',\n",

       " \"I've got an NHibernate 4 project with several collection relationships. I'm unit-testing the object model, exercising all the collections. Most work fine, but in one case, the child collection is cascade-saved properly, but on loading the parent entity and examining the collection property, the child collection is empty.\\nHere are the abbreviated classes.  GatewayUser is the parent object, and it has a collection of Student. The collection has a private backing property, and AddStudent/RemoveStudent methods.\\nFurther complications: I'm using the NHibernate.AspNet.Identity library for OAuth2 user management, and GatewayUser inherits from IdentityUser. That in turn inherits from the the library's internal base entity class, which is different from my project's own base class.\\npublic class GatewayUser : IdentityUser\\n    {\\n        public GatewayUser()\\n        {\\n        }\\n\\nStudent is more ordinary; it inherits from my own BaseEntity class, has many value properties, and its own child collection of ProgramApplication items. Interestingly, this collection saves and loads fine; it's got the same structure (private backer, etc.) as the failing collection in GatewayUser.\\nThe mapping is complicated, because the library internally maps its classes with NHiberante.Mapping.ByCode.Conformist classes (which I have no prior experience with).\\nI'm mapping my own classes with NHibernate automapping, because I have so many classes and properties to map. To get it all working, I copied the library's mapping helper class, and modified it a bit to add my base entity classes to it's list called baseEntityToIgnore. I also had to create a conformist mapping for GatewayUser, since it has a different base entity type, and my automapping wouldn't pick it up.\\nThe unit test looks like this:\\n\\nThe generated SQL inserts into both AspNetUsers and GatewayUser (reflecting the inheritance relationship), and inserts two records into Student. All good. On fetching, the SELECT joins the two user tables, and I get a GatewayUser object, but accessing the Students collection does not trigger a SELECT on the Student table. But if I change the mapping to Lazy(CollectionLazy.NoLazy), the SQL to select eagerly load Students appears in the log, but the collection is not populated.  If I switch the database from SQLite to Sql Server, I see the student records in the table. The generated SQL (when NoLazy is applied) will fetch them. So on the database end, things look fine.\\nI have to think my Frankenstein mapping situation is to blame. I'm mixing the library's conformist mapping with Fluent mapping, and there are two different base entity classes. However, the generated schema looks correct, and the save cascades correctly, so I don't know if that's the issue.\\n\",\n",

I\\'m trying to make it more simplified and automated through a SQL database that I can then wrap a web app around to enter daily stat updates.  \\nIt\\'s premised on our participation in another commercial site where we trade virtual shares of athletes, and thus acquire an \"ownership percentage\" in each athlete.  For instance, if there are 100 shares of AROD, and I own 10 shares, then I own 10%.  It then applies this to traditional baseball rotisserie scoring.  So, for instance, if AROD has 1 HR today, then his adjusted HR stat would be 1.10.  If he also has 2 RBI\\'s, then his adjusted RBI stat today would be 2.20, based on (2 x 1.10)(1 to normalize the stat, and the .10 to represent the ownership percentage).\\nAll the stats for my team would then be summed each day and added to my stat history to come to an aggregated total.  After that, points are allocated based on the ranking of each participant in each category at the end of the day.  E.g. if there are 10 participants, and I have the highest total aggregate number of Adjusted HR\\'s, then I get 10 pts.  The points are then summed across the different stat categories to come up with a total point ranking for that day.\\nAn added difficulty is that ownership %\\'s can change on a daily basis.\\nSo far, in playing around with different schema, I don\\'t know that having a separate table for each athlete\\'s stats and each player\\'s ownership %\\'s is the wisest choice.  It seems to me that simply having two tables, one that contains the daily stat information for each athlete, and another that shows the ownership % of each player.

We\\'d perhaps keep a textfile in that directory as a log of what has been moved, and why.\\n2) In /sw/, initialize a Git repository. Then, each time we do cleanup and something is removed, we would first add and commit it to the /sw/ repository, then remove the files, then commit that change. Then if we discover something should not have been removed, we can just revert that change.\\nWhich one seems like the best/safest strategy? I sometimes hear \"keep everything under version control\". But is it just making things more complicated in this case? Or would it be a benefit?\\nIs there some other way than the two points listed above?\\n',\n",

       " \"I've become responsible for cleaning up an old unit-testing environment. The existing environment contains a ton of executables (1000+ shell scripts, compiled binaries, etc) and each one returns code 0 or 1 and some output depending on the results. Tests can also time out. A set of PERL scripts goes through, runs each executable file, and collects the results into a big XML file which gets rendered into a web page. This system works great, but isn't very extensible or fast.\\nIn addition to cleaning/speeding this up, I would like to implement concurrent testing. Right now the tests run one at a time. Many of the tests require resource locks (ports, files, etc) and there's no listing of which are safe to run simultaneously. An option here is to run each one in a VM of some kind. \\nIs there a framework or tool designed for this type of situation? What's the best way to approach it if I have to write my own brand new system? My limitation is that I cannot change the 1000+ test executables. I was thinking something like PyUnit with Python unit tests that use subprocess or similar to execute the existing tests and convert the results into a Pythonic format. Is this overkill? Could such a system support isolation of processes to avoid deadlocks and race conditions between tests? In a worst-case, I was thinking of using Python to SSH into one of several VM's to run the tests.\\nAny help or guidance would be appreciated.\\nEdit: Python isn't strictly necessary. Another solution might just break the test set into several M-sized chunks and run each test in an independent VM over SSH until all M-sized chunks are done.

(some data need to be processed first before pushing such data into the invert index) I can allocate a lot of memory for it, but hey, we got 50 GB of RAM with the current invert index alone already. And that leads to second problem (2), our server has a lot of people using, and with 50 GB of space or more, our data will become fragmented all around in the hard disks.\\nAlternatively, what if I use file I/O to manage this and make a B-Tree like a hierarchical directory?

       " 'I\\'m trying to implement one complex algorithm using GPU. The only problem is HW limitations and maximum available feature level is 9_3.\\nAlgorithm is basically \"stereo matching\"-like algorithm for two images. Because of mentioned limitations all calculations has to be performed in Vertex/Pixel shaders only (there is no computation API available). Vertex shaders are rather useless here so I considered them as pass-through vertex shaders.\\nLet me shortly describe the algorithm:\\n\\nTake two images and calculate cost volume maps (basically conterting RGB to Grayscale -> translate right image by D and subtract it from the left image). This step is repeated around 20 times for different D which generates Texture3D. \\n\\nProblem here: I cannot simply create one Pixel Shader which calculates\\n  those 20 repetitions in one go because of size limitation of Pixel\\n  Shader (max. 512 arithmetics), so I\\'m forced to call Draw() in a loop\\n  in C++ which unnecessary involves CPU while all operations are done on\\n  the same two images - it seems to me like I have one bottleneck here. I know that there are multiple render targets but: there are max. 8 targets (I need 20+), if I want to generate 8 results in one pixel shader I exceed it\\'s size limit (512 arithmetic for my HW).\\n\\nThen I need to calculate for each of calculated textures box filter with windows where r > 9.\\n\\nAnother problem here: Because window is so big I need to split box filtering into two Pixel Shaders (vertical and horizontal direction separately) because loops unrolling stage results with very long code. Manual implementation of those loops won\\'t help cuz still it would create to big pixel shader. So another bottleneck here - CPU needs to be involved to pass results from temp texture (result of V pass) to the second pass (H pass).\\n\\nThen in next step some arithmetic operations are applied for each pair of results from 1st step and 2nd step. \\n\\nI haven\\'t reach yet here with my development so no idea what kind of bottlenecks are waiting for me here.\\n\\nThen minimal D (value of parameter from 1st step) is taken for each pixel based on pixel value from step 3. \\n\\n... same as in step 3.\\n\\n\\nHere basically is VERY simple graph showing my current implementation (excluding steps 3 and 4).\\n\\n\\n\\nRed dots/circles/whatever are temporary buffers (textures) where partial results are stored and at every red dot CPU is getting involved. \\nQuestion 1: Isn\\'t it possible somehow to let GPU know how to perform each branch form up to the bottom without involving CPU and leading to bottleneck? I.e. to program sequence of graphics pipelines in one go and then let the GPU do it\\'s job.\\nOne additional question about render-to-texture thing: Does all textures resides in GPU memory all the time even between Draw() method calls and Pixel/Vertex shaders switching? Or there is any transfer from GPU to CPU happening... Cuz this may be another issue here which leads to bottleneck. \\nAny help would be appreciated! \\nThank you in advance.\\nBest regards,\\nLukasz \\n',\n",
